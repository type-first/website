# State of the Code — Consolidated Synthesis (v1)

This is the unified synthesis of Codex and Claude analyses. It captures the stable core (Tier 1), the features to keep with functional changes (Tier 2), duplicate/alternate implementations, gaps/issues, and a concrete, ordered action plan.

Quick nav:
- [Overview & Scope](01-overview.md)
- [Tier 1: Current Keepers](02-tier-1.md)
- [Tier 2: Keep UI, Fix Functionality](03-tier-2.md)
- [Alternates & Duplications](04-alternates.md)
- [Gaps, Issues & Inconsistencies](05-gaps-issues.md)
- [Unified Recommendations & Plan](06-unified-actions.md)
- [Open Questions](07-open-questions.md)
- [Reference Mapping (files)](08-mapping.md)
- [Codex vs Claude: Differences](09-codex-vs-claude.md)
- [Roadmap Outline](10-roadmap.md)

Note: Claude’s docs found under `state-of-the-code/claude/v0/*` (no `v1` present). This consolidation merges those with Codex findings.
