# Open Questions

- Should contributor and terminology pages be exposed as routes, or kept as content-only (consumed by article pages and SEO tools)?
- Labs catalog: generate from `content/labs/*` or keep `registry.labs.tsx` as the single source of truth?
- Articles registry: partially generated from `content/articles/*` metadata, or kept fully hand-curated?
- Section-level embeddings only, or also article-level embedding? (Impacts hybrid search ranking.)
