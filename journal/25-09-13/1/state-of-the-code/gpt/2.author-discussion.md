# Filesystem Architecture (Prose)

This document examines alternative strategies for structuring the filesystem in a content-as-source architecture. Each approach reflects different priorities—simplicity, scalability, type safety, or performance—and each comes with corresponding trade-offs and migration paths.

---

## Approach A: Flat Content Organization

The first approach organizes all canonical content into a single flat hierarchy with minimal nesting. Articles, contributors, terminology, and labs each have their own folders, but every article is a single file rather than a nested module. Shared type definitions and registry exports live alongside the content in the same layer. Utilities for factories, validation, and derivation are kept in the `lib` directory, while routes and UI components reside in `app`.

An article such as “Advanced TypeScript Patterns” would exist as one file. It would contain both its metadata and the implementation of sections in a monolithic format. The metadata would include the article’s identifier, title, description, tags, author, status, difficulty level, and other properties. Sections could be written inline as React components.

The advantages of this design are clarity and ease of navigation. The structure is simple to browse, with minimal path complexity and fast file operations. Content is quick to discover and edit, and each type has a clear place.

The disadvantages appear as content grows. Articles with multiple sections quickly become unwieldy in a single file, sharing of components between articles is awkward, and there is no convention for attaching assets such as diagrams or data files. Scalability suffers when hundreds of articles accumulate, and developers encounter limitations in organization.

---

## Approach B: Hierarchical Content Modules

The second approach is more structured. Each content item—such as an article, contributor, terminology entry, or lab—resides in its own dedicated directory. For an article, this directory contains a metadata file, a main content file, subdirectories for sections and snippets, an assets folder for diagrams or images, and a derivation folder for generated artifacts like Markdown or embeddings.

Taking the TypeScript Patterns article as an example: its metadata would define identifiers, tags, difficulty, and learning objectives; individual sections like “Introduction,” “Conditional Types,” and “Mapped Types” would each be their own files; code snippets and sample data would live in dedicated subfolders; assets could include diagrams in SVG or sample JSON data; and derivations might store the Markdown export or vector embeddings. The module would export everything via a local index.

The benefits of this design are clarity, modularity, and scalability. Each article or concept is encapsulated, assets are colocated, and reusable shared components can live in a dedicated `shared` folder. The structure supports hundreds of articles without collapsing into disorder.

The downsides are deeper nesting, more complex import paths, and slower filesystem navigation. Developers must maintain discipline in consistent patterns, and trivial content items may feel over-engineered.

---

## Approach C: Domain-Driven Content Architecture

The third approach organizes content by domain rather than by content type. Each domain—such as TypeScript, React, or Web APIs—contains its own articles, terminology, labs, and shared components. A TypeScript domain, for instance, might include articles on patterns and fundamentals, terminology entries on type safety and generics, a lab for exploring types interactively, and shared visualization components.

Each domain exports its own registry, which aggregates its articles, terminology, and labs. A unified content registry spans all domains, enabling global queries and cross-domain search. Contributors remain cross-domain but still reside in `content`. Infrastructure such as factories, validators, and cross-reference utilities sits in a shared `infrastructure` folder, while derived artifacts like embeddings or search indices are kept in a generated folder.

This model emphasizes conceptual cohesion. Related content is grouped together, relationships are easier to perceive, and domain-specific tooling has a natural place. It scales effectively to large ecosystems where multiple domains grow in parallel.

The costs are complexity and ambiguity. Navigating across domains is harder, import and reference patterns become more complicated, and defining clear domain boundaries is non-trivial. Cross-domain relationships, such as an article in React citing a concept in TypeScript, require careful handling.

---

## Import and Export Strategies

Three patterns are considered for exposing content. The first is barrel exports with type safety, where each content type has an index that re-exports metadata and content modules in a single aggregate. The second is dynamic imports with lazy loading, where articles are loaded asynchronously by slug, reducing initial bundle size. The third is a generated registry produced at build time by scanning the content tree, importing metadata, and emitting a unified TypeScript file with all entries.

---

## Migration Strategies

Moving from the current structure can follow one of three paths.

* A gradual migration moves one article at a time into the new structure, updates imports, and validates behavior before proceeding.
* A parallel migration builds a new structure alongside the old, bridges the two with compatibility layers, and transitions articles progressively.
* A big bang migration moves all content at once, updates every reference, and requires extensive testing to ensure nothing breaks.

The gradual approach is lowest risk, the parallel approach balances continuity and speed, and the big bang approach maximizes speed at the cost of risk.

---

## Performance and Scalability

Flat structures are lightweight, with shallow directory depth and minimal build overhead, but scale poorly beyond a hundred items. Hierarchical modules handle hundreds comfortably, with moderate build costs and medium maintenance burden. Domain-driven structures scale to thousands of items but demand careful organization and impose higher build overhead and complexity.

---

## Recommendation

The recommended strategy is hybrid. Begin with a flat structure for immediate implementation and quick wins. As content grows, evolve into hierarchical modules for clarity and modularity. For very large ecosystems spanning multiple conceptual areas, adopt domain-driven architecture.

This phased progression allows immediate productivity, natural evolution, and long-term scalability, while balancing type safety, maintainability, and performance.

# Addenda: File-Backed Embeddings and “Docs” as First-Class Content

## 1. File-Backed Embeddings (DB-Optional Retrieval Plane)

### 1.1 Principle

Embeddings are **derived artifacts** and should be **addressable files** co-located with their canonical source, not primary records in a database. The registry becomes the *only* resolver: it maps canonical content IDs to their on-disk embedding shards and exposes an in-memory view suitable for search/chat pipelines. The database becomes optional (e.g., for analytics, federation, or multi-node replication), not a dependency for correctness.

### 1.2 Deterministic Layout and Addressing

Each canonical unit (article, term, lab, doc) yields a deterministic artifact path derived from a stable content hash of the normalized text segments. Segment-level files allow partial updates without reindexing the world. The addressing scheme should be stable across branches and CI runners:

* Path shape: content-root / content-kind / slug / derivation / embeddings / `{segment-hash}.{format}`
* Segment identity: `sha256(NFC(normalized_markdown_or_text))`
* Shard manifests: a compact index file listing segment hashes, model metadata, and offsets for rapid load.

### 1.3 Registry Responsibilities

The registry assumes three explicit duties:

1. **Presence/Integrity:** verify that for each canonical segment the corresponding embedding file exists, matches the expected hash, and advertises the correct embedder/version.
2. **Index Assembly:** lazily unify segment files into an in-memory search index (vector + lexical) with zero DB round-trips. Warm paths are memoized per build/runtime epoch.
3. **Freshness Signaling:** compute a “derivation freshness” bit by comparing content hashes against manifest entries. Stale items are flagged; consumers may choose to degrade to text-only search or allow mixed freshness.

### 1.4 CI Pipeline Implications

* **Pure derivation step:** normalization → segmentation → hashing → embedding → write artifacts.
* **Change detection:** only segments whose normalized text hash changed are re-embedded.
* **Model/version pinning:** embedder ID and tokenizer checksum are recorded in each artifact and in the shard manifest. Any model change is a breaking revision requiring backfill or dual-read (old+new) until migration completes.
* **Budgeting:** enforce token/compute ceilings; on breach, the run fails or drops to text-only mode with an explicit degraded flag written next to artifacts for observability.
* **Artifacts as build outputs:** CI publishes embedding directories as build artifacts and (optionally) promotes them to a content cache (e.g., object storage) keyed by commit SHA.

### 1.5 Runtime and Performance

* **Cold start:** the registry can boot with **lexical-only** search while a background thread (in-process) memory-maps or streams embeddings.
* **Memory mapping:** prefer `mmap`-friendly binary formats (contiguous float32 blocks + sidecar offsets) over JSON when feasible; JSON remains acceptable for early phases but penalizes cold boot.
* **Partial load:** load only the subsets required by the active domain or route; keep global indices optional.

### 1.6 Failure Modes and Guarantees

* **Missing artifact:** fall back to text-only search for the affected units; telemetry records the deficit.
* **Hash mismatch:** treat as corruption; quarantine the artifact and fail the health check for the search service.
* **Version skew:** if the embedder changed, dual-read or fail closed on `main`; allow degraded mode on feature branches.

### 1.7 Advantages and Trade-offs

* **Pros:** no DB latency for retrieval; reproducible, cacheable, portable; trivial local dev; easy branch isolation; clear provenance.
* **Cons:** artifact management complexity; potential filesystem fan-out; need for robust manifests; extra care for concurrency on multi-process servers.

---

## 2. “Docs” as a First-Class Content Category

### 2.1 Taxonomy and Boundaries

Introduce **Docs** as a distinct canonical content family alongside Articles, Terminology, Contributors, and Labs. Docs bifurcate into:

1. **Library Docs:** authoritative references for the `@typefirst/*` libraries (API references, upgrade guides, design notes, migration advisories, changelogs).
2. **Concept Docs:** technical doctrines and methodologies (e.g., *content-as-source*, multimodal authoring, derivation contracts, registry semantics).

Docs differ from Articles in two ways:

* **Contractual bindings:** Library Docs carry **versioned contracts** and stability annotations (e.g., since/deprecated, semver ranges, migration paths).
* **Reference density:** Concept Docs are **cross-referential hubs**, expected to index and normatively cite Articles, Labs, and Terminology entries.

### 2.2 Authoring Model

Docs are authored as **multimodal modules** with explicit sections for:

* **Front matter:** version, status (draft/review/stable/deprecated), target audience, and compatibility notes.
* **Spec blocks:** normative statements (MUST/SHOULD) with testable assertions that derivation can extract into machine-checkable lists.
* **Reference maps:** outbound links to APIs, examples, and related concepts; inbound expectations (who should cite this doc).

### 2.3 Registry Semantics for Docs

The registry must add **doc-aware indices**:

* **Version index:** map `(package, version-range)` → doc sets (reference, migration, changelog).
* **Concept graph:** maintain `concept → {articles, labs, terms, docs}` adjacency lists to enable “teach me this concept” queries across modalities.
* **Stability matrix:** record stability levels and deprecation epochs; search surfaces can weight stable references higher for novice audiences and surface migration docs for deprecated symbols.

### 2.4 Derivation and Embeddings for Docs

* **Granularity:** embed **section-level** units (API groups, conceptual subsections, migration steps) so the assistant can cite the exact normative paragraph.
* **Metadata folding:** include semver ranges, stability tags, and concept tags in the normalized text before embedding to bias retrieval toward relevance.
* **OpenGraph/SEO:** generate doc-specific OG cards that include version badges and status indicators; expose machine-readable JSON-LD for library documentation.

### 2.5 Filesystem Placement and Evolution

* **Minimal:** `content/docs/{libraries,concepts}/<slug>/…` with the same multimodal layout used by Articles.
* **Library synchronization:** optional pipeline step that ingests `@typefirst/*` package metadata (CHANGELOG.md, API extract, typed public surface) into Doc modules; keep doc authorship in repo to preserve “content as source.”

### 2.6 Product Surfaces That Benefit Immediately

* **Search:** “how to migrate from v2 to v3” resolves to a Doc section with explicit steps.
* **Chat:** RAG answers ground themselves in normative Concept Docs rather than blog-like Articles.
* **Site navigation:** domain or package pages aggregate related Docs, Articles, and Labs via the concept graph without bespoke glue code.

---

## 3. Contract Adjustments Across the Stack

### 3.1 Registry API Extensions

* **Embeddings-as-files:** add `getEmbeddingManifest(contentId)` and `streamEmbeddings(contentId, segmentIds?)`.
* **Doc queries:** add `findDocsByPackage(pkg, range?)`, `findDocsByConcept(tag)`, and `resolveConceptNeighborhood(concept, depth)`.

### 3.2 Search Backend

* **Dual path default:** lexical index is always available; vector path becomes active when artifact manifests validate.
* **Reranking hooks:** prefer doc sections labeled normative or migration when query intent implies “how” or “should.”

### 3.3 CI Gates

* **Doc linting:** enforce presence of version/status in Library Docs; fail builds when public API diffs lack corresponding migration notes.
* **Embedding parity:** any doc or article change requires fresh segment artifacts; stale derivations block `main`.

### 3.4 Observability

* Emit structured logs for: missing artifact, version skew, corrupted shard, concept graph gaps (unresolved references), and doc–package drift.

---

## 4. Risks and Mitigations

* **Artifact sprawl:** mitigate with shard manifests, content-addressed directories, and periodic compaction jobs that coalesce tiny segments into larger blocks.
* **Version drift in Library Docs:** integrate a **public-surface extractor** (TypeScript program analysis) that flags undocumented changes; build fails until docs reconcile.
* **Concept graph inconsistencies:** run a nightly integrity job that detects orphaned concepts and broken cross-references; open automated issues with suggested fixes.
* **Performance cliffs:** introduce lazy, domain-scoped index loading and memory-mapped binary formats before scale makes JSON untenable.

---

## 5. Immediate Actions

1. **Define artifact schema:** binary + manifest spec (segment hash, tokenizer checksum, model ID, createdAt).
2. **Wire registry adapters:** file-backed embedding resolver and doc-aware indices; keep DB adapters behind the same interface but mark them optional.
3. **Introduce Docs:** scaffold `content/docs/{libraries,concepts}`; migrate *content-as-source* manifesto and one `@typefirst/*` library reference as exemplars.
4. **CI enforcement:** add parity checks for changed content and doc lint rules for version/status fields.
5. **Search tuning:** weight normative Doc sections above narrative Articles for policy and migration intents; expose intent flags in the API to allow determinism.

These changes formalize embeddings as **portable, reproducible artifacts** and elevate **Docs** to a first-class, typed content family that anchors both code-facing references and conceptual doctrine.

- the registry would accept typed objects like articles with sections, tags, summaries, embeddings, relations to other content entities, and async retrieval methods for non-content data like number of likes and comments. the article sections themselves would be fully fledged content entities with their own embeddings, descriptions, tags and relations

# Registry Contract Addendum: Typed Entities, Section-Level Canonicality, and Asynchronous Non-Content Facets

## 1. Canonical Object Model

The registry ingests **typed content objects** rather than loose payloads. Each object is a canonical entity with explicit fields for identity, modality, derivations, and graph relations. The object includes: a stable identifier; a type discriminator; authored metadata (title, summary, tags, authored timestamps); **derivation manifests** (embeddings, markdown, plaintext, JSON-LD); **relations** to other entities (authorship, prerequisites, “see also,” mentions, backlinks); and **capabilities** declaring what can be rendered or exported. Objects are **immutable by default**; mutations are modeled as new versions with content-addressed derivations.

## 2. Articles as Aggregates; Sections as First-Class Entities

An **Article** is an aggregate root composed of **Section** entities. Sections are not merely structural fragments; they are **independent content entities** with their own identifiers, summaries, tags, embeddings, and relations. The article aggregates sections via ordered membership; sections may also participate in cross-article relations (e.g., a “Background” section reused in two articles via reference). Consequences:

* **Retrieval granularity:** search and RAG operate at section granularity by default, article granularity by intent.
* **Attribution and provenance:** citations can target a section, preserving precision for assistants and SEO.
* **Selective regeneration:** derivation pipelines re-embed only changed sections, not entire articles.

## 3. Typed Fields and Capabilities

Each entity exposes a **typed capability surface**:

* **Identity:** globally unique content ID; stable slug; canonical link.
* **Authored metadata:** title, summary, tags, domain, audience, difficulty, status.
* **Derivations:** a manifest of available artifacts with creation timestamps, toolchain versions, and content hashes. Presence implies readiness; absence implies a degraded but defined fallback.
* **Relations:** explicit outbound edges (author, prerequisites, references) and computed inbound edges (backlinks).
* **Constraints:** invariants such as “section must belong to exactly one primary article” or “prerequisite must resolve to a published article section or article.”

## 4. Asynchronous Non-Content Facets

Non-canonical, dynamic attributes—**likes, comments, view counts, reaction summaries**—are **asynchronous retrievals** attached to an entity through typed methods. They do not alter the canonical content state. The registry provides **stable async accessors** with clear semantics:

* **Consistency:** eventual consistency is acceptable; responses include freshness metadata.
* **Degradation:** if the backing service is unavailable, accessors return a typed degraded state rather than throwing opaque errors.
* **Isolation:** failure of non-content retrieval must not taint canonical content reads, derivations, or graph traversal.

## 5. Embedding Strategy and Provenance

Embeddings exist at both **section** and **article** levels, with section-level artifacts considered primary. Article-level embeddings are derived summaries used for coarse recall. Every embedding artifact records the normalized text hash, tokenizer checksum, embedder version, and creation time. The registry enforces:

* **Idempotence:** embedding freshness is computed by comparing normalized text hash against artifact manifests.
* **Dual-read periods:** when embedder versions change, the registry can serve a dual index until backfills complete.
* **Preference rules:** retrieval prefers section embeddings; reranking may incorporate article embeddings and lexical signals.

## 6. Graph Semantics

Content relations form a **typed, directed multigraph**. Nodes are Articles, Sections, Contributors, Terminology, Labs, Docs; edges include authorship, prerequisite, elaborates, cites, is-part-of, and related-concept. The registry maintains:

* **Forward and reverse indices** for constant-time neighbor lookups.
* **Neighborhood materialization** to power query intents such as “teach me this” (concept → sections → articles → labs).
* **Integrity checks** that flag dangling edges, cycles violating constraints (e.g., cyclic prerequisites), and stale references to unpublished nodes.

## 7. Registry API Surface

The registry’s public surface is **typed and modality-aware**:

* **Get:** fetch canonical entity (article or section) with typed metadata, derivations, and relations.
* **Search:** query across nodes with explicit granularity (section default), filtering by tags, domain, audience, and status; returns typed hits with provenance and confidence signals.
* **Neighbors:** resolve relational neighborhoods (e.g., prerequisites, backlinks, concept adjacency).
* **Derivations:** enumerate or stream artifacts (markdown, plaintext, embeddings); expose freshness and version state.
* **Dynamic facets:** async methods `getReactions`, `getCommentSummary`, `getViewStats` with freshness, rate-limit, and degradation semantics.

## 8. Integrity, Validation, and CI

Integrity is enforced at **ingest** and **build**:

* **Schema validation:** entities must satisfy type and invariant checks; sections must declare a parent article; required derivations are present for publishable states.
* **Reference validation:** all outbound edges must resolve; unresolved references degrade to warnings in draft and errors in published states.
* **Derivation parity:** content changes require fresh section embeddings; stale artifacts block promotion to mainline unless explicitly marked as degraded for non-production branches.
* **Graph hygiene:** periodic passes detect orphans, dead backlinks, and forbidden cycles; failures surface as actionable reports.

## 9. Performance and Caching

* **Primary keying at section level** reduces re-embed and re-index scope.
* **Shard manifests** enable partial loads by domain or article; cold starts favor lexical search while vector shards are memory-mapped or streamed.
* **Memoized neighborhoods** accelerate common graph traversals (e.g., article → sections → related articles).
* **Async facet caches** use short TTLs and carry ETags to avoid unnecessary backend round-trips.

## 10. Migration and Authoring Impact

* **Authoring discipline:** writers structure content into semantically coherent sections with explicit summaries and tags; this is not decoration but the basis for retrieval quality.
* **Incremental adoption:** legacy monolithic articles can be segmented gradually; each extracted section becomes a first-class node with its own derivations and relations.
* **Backfill strategy:** initial embeddings can be article-level only; CI progressively emits section embeddings as segments stabilize.

## 11. Failure Semantics

* **Missing derivations:** registry serves lexical results with explicit “vector-degraded” signals; assistants adapt rankers accordingly.
* **Broken relations:** published entities fail CI; drafts surface warnings and suggested fixes.
* **Async facet failure:** return typed degraded values with diagnostic context; never block canonical reads.

## 12. Rationale

Treating **sections as first-class entities** aligns the retrieval grain with the user’s question grain, improves precision for assistants and search, and minimizes derivation churn. Making **non-content metrics asynchronous** preserves the purity and portability of canonical content while enabling product surfaces to project live signals. A **typed registry contract** enforces these separations, renders behavior predictable under failure, and provides the operational levers (freshness, provenance, versioning) necessary for trustworthy multimodal derivation and RAG.
