# Open Questions

- Search backend: adopt `lib/search/index.ts` or keep `lib/search.ts` shape as canonical?
- Article routing: any reason to keep `/articles/[slug]` variant around for legacy links?
- Community scope: is voting required in initial cut, or staged later?
- Islands: future use in multimodal articles or remain in schema-rendered content/tests only?
- Auth UI: any consumer of `AuthMenuClient.tsx` that needs preserving?
