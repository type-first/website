# Overview & Scope

This consolidation aligns both analyses into a shared, actionable view of the codebase.

- Tier 1: Stable, current patterns worth preserving as reference implementations.
- Tier 2: Features with good UI/UX that need functional completion or refactors.
- Alternates: Parallel approaches and duplicate implementations to be reconciled later.
- Gaps/Issues: Missing routes, persistence stubs, path inconsistencies, and drift.
- Plan: Sequenced tasks keeping UI stable while tightening functionality.

Source inputs:
- Claude: `state-of-the-code/claude/v0/*`
- Codex: `State of the Code/Codex/*`

Conventions used here assume the article route is `/article/[slug]` (canonical), with consistent linking across the app.
